## Leet Code Problems

This repo stores the result of a personal initiative to study and practice how to solve [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) Problems.

Some notes about those problems:
- `com.lazarin.learning.*` - those packages have all code I created to practice the main data structures/algorithms needed to solve those problems:
  - Arrays (2D and 3D), queues, graphs, stacks, linked lists, trees, trie etc.;
  - Sorting, searching, recursion, heaps etc.
- `com.lazarin.googlequestions.interviewprocess` - this package stores some problems specifically asked by Google (I picked those problems from 'LeetCode - Google 150 problems' list);
- `com.lazarin.blindlistandmore.*` - the initial purpose of those packages was to store the famous blind 75 list problems, however, with the time, it started getting bigger and bigger....

### Getting trouble to solve this kind of problem?

Following bellow a few important sources that helped me a lot (and being honest, some solutions I got after watching the explanations on those YouTube channels):
